# kmeans-vs-hierarchical-clustering
The data provided is of various customers of a bank and their financial attributes like credit limit, the total number of credit cards the customer has, and different channels through which customers have contacted the bank for any queries (including visiting the bank, online and through a call center)

Context
In the year to come, AllLife Bank plans to concentrate on its credit card user base.
Their marketing research team has given them advice on how to increase market penetration. The marketing team suggests running customized campaigns to target both new customers and existing customers for upselling.
The clients' negative perception of the back support services was another finding from the market research. The Operations team intends to improve the service delivery model in light of this in order to ensure that customer inquiries are handled quickly.
Both the head of marketing and the head of delivery decide to ask the data science team for assistance.

Objective
To identify different segments in the existing customer, based on their spending patterns as well as past interaction with the bank, using clustering algorithms, and provide recommendations to the bank on how to better market to and service these customers.
